# Subtle Discord bot

In an attempt to put my python skills to a test and learning further, instead of inviting an already made Discord bot to my CTF server, I decided to create my own bot.

The main functionality I'm looking for to implement is for people to be able to assign roles themselves when reacting to certain emojis in a given message.

If you want to check it out, go ahead and look at the code and make your own bot yourself! 

To accomplish this, I grabbed the code of a MIT licensed bot and modified it to my taste, then I uploaded it to the cloud for 24/7 runtime.
